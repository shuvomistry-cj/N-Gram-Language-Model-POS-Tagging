# 📝 N-Gram Language Model & POS Tagging  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) application** built using **Streamlit** and **NLTK**. It provides two main features:  
1️⃣ **N-Gram Language Model**: Analyzes text and predicts the probability of the next word.  
2️⃣ **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigns grammatical labels (e.g., noun, verb) to words in a sentence.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ User input-based **N-Gram Language Model** (Bigrams/Trigrams)  
✅ **Perplexity Calculation** to measure model performance  
✅ **POS Tagging** using Rule-Based, Stochastic, and NLTK methods  
✅ Streamlit-based **interactive interface**  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuvomistry-cj/nlp-lab-assignment.git
   cd nlp-lab-assignment

2️⃣ Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py
📖 How It Works
🔹 N-Gram Model:

Splits text into n-grams and calculates conditional probabilities.
Supports smoothing to handle unseen words.
Computes perplexity, which indicates how well the model predicts text.
🔹 POS Tagging:

Rule-Based: Uses manually defined rules for common words.
Stochastic: Uses a UnigramTagger trained on the Brown Corpus.
NLTK POS Tagger: Uses pre-trained models for tagging.
